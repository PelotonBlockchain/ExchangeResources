# ExchangeResources

ExchangeResources contains samples, documentation and API definitions to assist developers working with the Peloton Exchange system.

## Peloton Blockchain
Peloton Blockchain is NOT a market operator and does not provide a facility for trading.

Peloton Blockchain makes the Peloton Exchange software available to market and ATS operators.  The Peloton Exchange software is a multi-currency, multi-board trading system designed to provide a trading platform for Security Tokens / Digital Securities.  It includes a rich set of market operations and surveillance capabilities.

If you would like to develop against an online test market, please contact us directly at https://pelotonblockchain.com.


## Protobuf Gateway
The Peloton Exchange system includes a Gateway that offers API connectivity for placing orders and receiving market data.

This repository includes a protobuf ("protocol buffers") file that describes the Exchange Gateway API.  

Check out the [Google Developer Guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) pages to get started on protocol buffers.

TODO - sample client code coming soon!


## FIX Gateway 
The Peloton Exchange system includes a Gateway that offers FIX connectivity for placing orders and receiving market data.

Peloton Blockchain has not yet published FIX terms of engagement, because these are configurable by market or ATS operators using the Gateway.  Contact your local friendly market or ATS operator for their FIX terms.
